\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
So the main goal of the research was the design and analysis of a power-mixing DAC which works on a LO frequency of 2GHz, a data-bandwidth of 500MHz while providing 20.97dBm output power and a IMD3 higher than 30dBc. This was achieved by designing a D-flip-flop for synchronization, a NAND and a NOR port for mixing the data with the LO, a levelshifter which was able to drive the large and high voltage current sinks/sources and the current sinks and sources to provide a current through a matched 50Ohm antenna. As a result the power-mixing DAC was able to reach a data-bandwidth of 500MHz while providing an peak output power of 20 dBm. This all has lead to an IMD3 of at least 20 dBc. So this Power-Mixing-DAC is able to be used in the wifi-antenna in mobile phones.

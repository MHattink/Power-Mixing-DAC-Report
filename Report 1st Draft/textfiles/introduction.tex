\section{Introduction} \label{sec:introduction}
For this design there is chosen to create a combined traditional DAC, mixer and power amplifier (PA), because this leads to several advantages. One thing is that it results in a more compact solution. A compact solution allows the system to be faster, because there are less parasitic capacitances between the structures. Also the need of matching to 50 ohm between these structures becomes superfluous. Using such a combined system solution has a disadvantage that it is hard to generate high power, because power leakage generates heat which can damage the transistors. Moreover the use of large capacitors or inductors is not possible, because these require too much space to create in silicon. Normally they are placed on the PCB.
Such a solution could be useful for several systems. Mainly for systems that require high speed, low power or lack of sufficient available space for a PCB. One example for such a system is the WiFi connection in a mobile phone.

Modern integrated communication devices often require a power mixing Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC), which is capable of producing a radio signal with enough power to be directly connected to an antenna. This paper presents a 4-bit Power-Mixing-DAC. The goals to mix a signal with a maximum bandwidth of 500 MHz with a 2 GHz carrier wave, and to deliver a full swing output current of 50 mA to a 50$\Omega$ load with an IMD3 > 20 dBc. First the system and its requirements will be discussed. This is followed by a breakdown of the system in components. Finally the results will be presented and analyzed.

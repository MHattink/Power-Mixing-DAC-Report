\section{Hardware module}\label{sec:overview}
For this design there is chosen to create a system on chip (SoC) of a traditional DAC, mixer and power amplifier (PA), because this leads to several advantages. One thing is that it results in a more compact solution. A compact solution allows the system to be faster, because there are less parasitic capacitances between the structures. Also the need of matching to 50 ohm between these structures becomes superfluous. Using a SoC solution has a disadvantage that it is hard to generate high power, this generates heat which can damage the SoC. Moreover the use of large capacitors or inductors is not possible.
